# Book of Treasures Game Info Repo

Welcome. This repository is for any and all information regarding the old game from 2010-2016 era on Games.com and AOL.com called "Book of Treasures".

The endgoal of this repository is to revive/rebuild the game to work with HTML5 and then host it in the cloud for others to enjoy. 

Straight from the Web Archive description, "We enjoy word games so much that we decided to create one! Games.com proudly presents The Book of Treasuresâ„¢. Jessica West is a librarian at an ancient library that is rumored to house a lost Egyptian manuscript. One day she finds a secret room and discovers 35 envelopes, each containing six letters. Her curiosity piqued, Jessica is on a mission to discover the secret of where the hidden manuscript resides. If you enjoy TextTwist but are ready for a word game and wraps a compelling mystery around challenging gameplay, The Book of Treasures will delight you. Three ways to play: * Quest Mode - Find all the pieces of the lost manuscript. * Endless Mode - Complete as many levels as you can and go for the high score. * Timeless Mode - Play with no time limit."
